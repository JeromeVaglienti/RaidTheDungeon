# RaidTheDungeon
2nd Game Project in first Year at Créajeux

#### Raid The Dungeon is one player / two player coop rogue like game where you are a new member of the order of the mages protecting your world against evils creatures.
You are one of the last mages living in this world.
The evil Razar conjures horrible monsters to achieve his ultimate goal: to destroy the entire world. Alone or in pairs, you will have to lead in bringing peace to this precious world.
To do so, you will have to find the source of these monsters, as they seem to appear in mysterious and dark dungeons.
Destroy all these monsters in your path, some may be more difficult than others, but don't lose sight of the main goal.
To defeat Razar himself.

This project was carried out during my first year of study at the school Créajeux (https://www.creajeux.fr/) in 9 weeks with C language and CSFML library.
